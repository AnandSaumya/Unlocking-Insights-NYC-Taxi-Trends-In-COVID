## $\text{Problem Statement:}$
With increasing competition from ride-sharing businesses and changes in customer behavior due to the pandemic, we were curious about how traditional taxi industries are adapting. By examining how various factors interlocked and changed over 2019-2022, we can gather key data-driven insights that can empower stakeholders to optimize taxi services.
Our project aims to delve into the trends surrounding taxi rides in the New York City and Brooklyn areas, identifying pivotal factors such as location, time, and pricing on ridership popularity, and how these factors were affected by the pandemic.

- Analyze historical trends from 2019-2022 to discern changes in ride frequency and passenger volume and the relationship between these statistics and COVID case counts.
- Examine geographical ridership patterns to pinpoint changes in popular hotspot locations, and analyze distances traveled, and ridership frequency.
- Investigate pricing trends over the pandemic and parameters including location, distance, and other pertinent factors.
- Explore the relationship between time-of-day and ridership popularity, and its correlation to pandemic peaks.
- Model and predict future taxi demand to better assist drivers with operations planning.

## $\text{Business Relevance:}$
By analyzing variables such as average passenger count and COVID-related metrics, we provide actionable insights for industry stakeholders to optimize operations and meet evolving consumer demands. Our analysis encompasses economic shifts, payment trends, fluctuations in trip patterns, and the resilience of key transportation hubs, offering a comprehensive view of the industry's response to dynamic market forces and empowering stakeholders to navigate future challenges effectively.
